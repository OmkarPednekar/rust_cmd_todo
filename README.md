# Command-Line To-Do App

Welcome to the **Command-Line To-Do App** project! This repository is a part of my journey to learn Rust by building practical projects. The goal of this project is to create a simple, yet functional to-do list application that runs in the command line.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:

1. **Learn Rust**: Practice and enhance my Rust programming skills.
2. **Build a CLI Tool**: Develop a command-line interface (CLI) application for managing to-do tasks.
3. **Understand Rust Concepts**: Gain hands-on experience with Rust concepts such as ownership, borrowing, modules, and more.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **View Tasks**: Display all current tasks.
- **Remove Tasks**: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Strike through completed tasks to keep track of progress.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your system. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/command-line-todo-app.git
   cd command-line-todo-app
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the following commands:

- **Add a Task**: Type the task description to add a new task.
- **View Tasks**: Use a specific command to list all current tasks.
- **Remove a Task**: Specify the task number or description to remove it from the list.
- **Mark a Task as Complete**: Mark tasks as completed to visually strike them through.
